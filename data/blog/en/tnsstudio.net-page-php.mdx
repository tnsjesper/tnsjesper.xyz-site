summary: TNS Studio Page and Project
---

Hello, I would like to tell something about my new website.
It is written in PHP and is mainly used because of upcoming functions.
I'll keep coding on it. Also to be added is a blog and other things for the web, such as a profile page and an application for various purposes.
A blog engine will also be integrated at myblog.com/yourname. All of these features will be accessible through one account, so we're working on that as well.
I'm always happy about your ideas. We are also planning a login option similar to Google, so that you can log in and register with TNSStudio-OAuth.
That is why we will deal with it intensively. If you have any ideas or applications, please send an email to contact@tnsstudio.net!

I look forward to it! Your tnsjesper
