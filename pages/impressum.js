        <div>
          This website contains links to websites of third parties (externallinks). These websites
          are the responsibility of the respectiveoperators. When the external links were first
          linked, the providerchecked the third-party content for any legal violations. At thattime,
          no legal violations were apparent. The provider has noinfluence on the current and future
          design and content of the linkedpages. The setting of external links does not mean that
          the provideradopts the content behind the reference or link as his own. Constantmonitoring
          of the external links is not reasonable for the providerwithout concrete evidence of legal
          violations. With knowledge oflegal violations, such external links will be deleted
          immediately.
